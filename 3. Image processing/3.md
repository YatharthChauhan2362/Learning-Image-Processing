# CHAPTER-3: IMAGE PROCESSING

## Pixel transformation

Pixel transformation is a fundamental concept in image processing that involves modifying the pixel values in an image to achieve certain objectives such as enhancing image contrast, brightness, sharpness, or color correction. There are various techniques for pixel transformation, some of which are:

1. Linear Transformation:

- Linear transformation involves scaling the pixel values of an image linearly, such as stretching the pixel values to cover the entire intensity range. It can be achieved by applying a scaling factor to the original pixel values.

2. Gamma Correction:

- Gamma correction is a non-linear transformation that adjusts the brightness levels of an image. It involves raising the pixel values to a power (gamma value) to make the image appear brighter or darker.

3. Histogram Equalization:

- Histogram equalization is a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image. It involves redistributing the pixel values in an image to cover the entire intensity range by using a cumulative distribution function (CDF).

4. Thresholding:

- Thresholding is a technique that converts an image into a binary image based on a threshold value. Pixels with values above the threshold are assigned one value, and pixels below the threshold are assigned another value.

5. Color Correction:

- Color correction involves adjusting the color balance of an image to correct for unwanted color shifts. It can be achieved by changing the color balance, hue, saturation, or contrast of an image.

6. Non-Linear Transformation:

- Non-linear transformation involves modifying the pixel values of an image non-linearly, such as using a logarithmic function to compress the dynamic range of an image. It can also be used to enhance the sharpness or remove noise in an image.

## Color transformation

Color transformation refers to the process of converting an image from one color space to another. This is often done to adjust the color balance or correct for color distortions or inconsistencies in the image.

There are several common color spaces used in image processing, including RGB, CMYK, HSV, and LAB. Each color space has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific application.

1.  RGB (Red-Green-Blue)

- RGB (Red-Green-Blue) is the most commonly used color space in digital imaging. It represents colors using a combination of red, green, and blue color channels, which can be combined to produce any color in the visible spectrum.

2. CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key)

- CMYK is primarily used in printing applications. It represents colors using four color channels, which are mixed to produce a wide range of colors.

3. HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value)

- HSV is a color space that separates color information into three components: hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity or purity of the color), and value (the brightness of the color).

4. LAB (Lightness-a-b)

- LAB is a color space that separates color information into three components: lightness (brightness), a (green-red) and b (blue-yellow) channels. LAB is often used in image processing algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and color correction.

To transform an image from one color space to another, a mathematical conversion formula is applied to each pixel in the image. The formula may involve simple matrix multiplication or more complex calculations involving color gamut mapping, white point adjustment, or gamma correction. The resulting image will have a different appearance and color distribution than the original image, depending on the specific color space used and the transformation applied.

## transformation, Composition and matching

Transformation, composition, and matching are important concepts in image processing that allow for the manipulation and analysis of images.

1. Transformation:

- Image transformation refers to the process of changing the appearance of an image using various techniques. Some common transformation techniques include scaling, rotation, translation, shearing, and warping. These transformations are often used to correct for image distortions, adjust the image size, or change the perspective of an object in the image.

2. Composition:

- Image composition refers to the process of combining multiple images or image elements into a single image. This can be done for various reasons, such as creating a panorama image by stitching together multiple photos, overlaying one image on top of another to create a composite image, or creating an animation by combining multiple frames into a single sequence.

3. Matching:

- Image matching refers to the process of comparing two or more images to identify similarities or differences. This can be done by comparing pixel values, identifying key features or landmarks in the image, or using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns or structures in the images. Image matching is often used in applications such as object recognition, face recognition, and image retrieval.

Overall, transformation, composition, and matching are important techniques in image processing that enable a wide range of applications and analyses of visual data.

## Histogram processing

Histogram processing is a fundamental technique used in image processing to analyze and manipulate the pixel values in an image. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel values in an image. In a histogram, the x-axis represents the range of pixel values, while the y-axis represents the frequency of occurrence of each pixel value.

Histogram processing involves applying various operations on the histogram to manipulate the pixel values in an image. Some of the common histogram processing techniques are:

1. Histogram Equalization:

- It is a technique used to adjust the contrast of an image by redistributing the pixel values in a way that enhances the visibility of details. The technique works by stretching the histogram such that the intensities are uniformly distributed over the full range of values. This results in an image with improved contrast and better visual appearance.

2. Histogram Specification:

- It is a technique used to match the histogram of one image with another image. This technique is useful when you want to adjust the color balance of an image to match another image. The technique involves modifying the pixel values of the input image to match the target histogram.

3. Histogram Stretching:

- It is a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image by stretching the histogram to span the full range of values. This technique is useful when an image has a low contrast and appears dull. The technique involves scaling the intensity values of the image to span the full range of pixel values.

Histogram processing is an important technique in image processing and is widely used in various applications such as medical image analysis, remote sensing, and computer vision.

## Linear filtering

Linear filtering is a common image processing technique that involves applying a convolution operation on an input image using a filter kernel. The filter kernel is a small matrix of weights that specify how to combine the neighboring pixels of an image to produce a new pixel value.

The general steps involved in linear filtering are as follows:

1. Define a filter kernel:

- This is a small matrix of numbers that specify the weights for combining the neighboring pixels. Common examples include Gaussian blur, edge detection, and sharpening filters.

2. Slide the filter kernel over the input image:

- At each pixel location, the filter kernel is centered over the pixel and the values of the neighboring pixels are multiplied by the corresponding weights in the kernel.

3. Sum the results of the multiplication:

- The resulting values from step 2 are summed to produce the output value for the current pixel location.

4. Repeat the process for all pixels in the image:

- The above steps are repeated for each pixel in the image, resulting in a new filtered image.

Linear filtering can be used for a variety of tasks, such as smoothing, noise reduction, edge detection, and feature extraction. However, it is important to choose an appropriate filter kernel and parameters for the specific task at hand, as the choice of kernel can greatly affect the output of the filter.

## Non-linear filtering

Non-linear filtering is an essential technique used in image processing to remove noise and enhance image features. Unlike linear filtering, non-linear filtering considers the relationship between neighboring pixels and can effectively remove noise while preserving important image features.

There are various types of non-linear filters used in image processing, including median filtering, rank filtering, and adaptive filtering.

1. Median filtering

- Median filtering is a commonly used non-linear filter that replaces the pixel value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. This filter is particularly useful in removing salt and pepper noise, which appears as randomly scattered black and white pixels in the image.

2. Rank filtering

- Rank filtering is another type of non-linear filter that replaces the pixel value with the rank of its neighboring pixels. This filter can be used to enhance image features, such as edges and textures, and to remove noise.

3. Adaptive filtering

- Adaptive filtering is a more advanced non-linear filtering technique that adjusts the filter parameters based on the local image characteristics. This filter can adapt to the varying characteristics of an image and provide better noise reduction and feature enhancement.

In summary, non-linear filtering is a crucial technique in image processing that helps remove noise and enhance image features. By considering the relationship between neighboring pixels, non-linear filters can effectively remove various types of noise and preserve important image features.
