# Basic Terminology

1. Image:

- A 2D array of pixels that represent a visual representation of an object, scene or pattern.

2. Pixel:

- The smallest unit of an image that can be processed or manipulated, usually represented by a single value or combination of values (e.g. grayscale or RGB values).

3. Resolution:

- The number of pixels in an image, usually measured in width x height (e.g. 640 x 480 pixels).

4. Color Space:

- A specific way of representing colors in an image, usually defined by a set of primary colors and a mathematical method for converting color values.

5. Bit Depth:

- The number of bits used to represent each pixel in an image, which determines the range of colors or shades of gray that can be displayed.

6. Histogram:

- A graph that shows the distribution of pixel values in an image, which can help to identify areas of contrast or brightness.

7. Filters:

- Algorithms that modify or enhance an image by changing the pixel values according to specific rules or mathematical operations.

8. Thresholding:

- A process of converting an image to binary format by separating pixels based on a specific threshold value.

9. Morphological Operations:

- Algorithms that manipulate the shape or structure of objects in an image, such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

10. Edge Detection:

- Algorithms that identify the boundaries between different regions of an image, usually by detecting sudden changes in pixel values or gradients.

11. Segmentation:

- The process of dividing an image into multiple regions or objects based on specific criteria, such as color, texture, or shape.

12. Feature Extraction:

- The process of identifying specific patterns or structures in an image, which can be used for further analysis or classification.
